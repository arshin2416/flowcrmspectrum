### UI Components
- **Dropdown Interface**: Clean, modern dropdown with search
- **User Avatars**: Shows user initials in colored circles
- **Checkboxes**: Visual indicators for selected users
- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner while fetching data
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no users are found

## üìÅ Files Overview

- `isMultiple`: Enable multiple selection (default: false)
- `placeholder`: Button and search placeholder text
- `availableUsers`: Optional pre-provided user list

### 2. ContactDetail.jsx
Contact details page that uses PeopleField for editing contacts.

**Integration:**
- Used in the "Edit Contact" modal
- Handles the `people_3` field for contacts
- Converts between API format and UI format
- Updates contact records with selected people

### 3. Contacts.jsx
Main contacts listing page with PeopleField integration.

**Integration:**
- Used in the "Add Contact" modal
- Allows selecting people when creating new contacts
- Handles form validation and submission

### 4. contactService.js
Backend service with data transformation utilities.

**Key Features:**
- `PeopleFieldUtils`: Converts between API and UI data formats
- `getPeople()`: Fetches available users from the API
- `create()` & `update()`: Handles saving contacts with people data

## üîÑ Data Flow

### 1. User Selection Process
```
User clicks "Add People..." button
‚Üì
Dropdown opens with search functionality
‚Üì
Component loads users from API (if not pre-provided)
‚Üì
User searches and selects people
‚Üì
Selected people appear as removable chips
‚Üì
Data is passed to parent component via onSelectionChange
```

### 2. Data Format Transformation

**UI Format (used by PeopleField):**
```javascript
{
  Id: 1,
  FirstName: "John",
  LastName: "Doe",
  Email: "john@example.com",
  _originalData: { /* original API data */ }
}
```

**API Format (used by backend):**
```javascript
{
  Id: 1,
  User: {
    Id: 1,
    FirstName: "John",
    LastName: "Doe",
    Email: "john@example.com"
  },
  ParentRecordId: 123
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Single Selection Example
```jsx
<PeopleField
  label="Project Manager"
  selectedPeople={singleSelection}
  onSelectionChange={setSingleSelection}
  isMultiple={false}
  placeholder="Select a project manager..."
/>
```

### Multiple Selection Example
```jsx
<PeopleField
  label="Team Members"
  selectedPeople={multipleSelection}
  onSelectionChange={setMultipleSelection}
  isMultiple={true}
  placeholder="Add team members..."
/>
```

### With Pre-provided Users
```jsx
<PeopleField
  label="Reviewers"
  selectedPeople={selectedReviewers}
  onSelectionChange={setSelectedReviewers}
  isMultiple={true}
  availableUsers={teamMembers}
  placeholder="Select reviewers..."
/>
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Contact Creation Flow
1. User opens "Add Contact" modal
2. Fills out contact information
3. Uses PeopleField to select associated people
4. Form submits with contact data + selected people
5. contactService.create() transforms and saves data

### Contact Update Flow
1. User opens "Edit Contact" modal
2. Existing people_3 data is loaded and converted to UI format
3. User can modify selected people using PeopleField
4. Form submits with updated data
5. contactService.update() handles the changes

### Data Transformation Utilities

**PeopleFieldUtils.toUIFormat():**
- Converts API format to UI format
- Handles missing fields gracefully
- Preserves original data for updates

**PeopleFieldUtils.toCreateFormat():**
- Converts UI format to API format for new records
- Returns null for empty selections

**PeopleFieldUtils.toUpdateFormat():**
- Converts UI format to API format for updates
- Preserves existing record IDs
- Handles both new and existing selections

## üé® Styling & Design

### Visual Elements
- **Selected People**: Appear as rounded chips with avatar and remove button
- **Dropdown**: Clean white background with subtle shadows
- **Search Input**: Prominent search bar with icon
- **User Items**: Hover effects and selection indicators
- **Loading States**: Spinning loader with helpful text

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Blue theme for buttons and selected states
- **Secondary**: Slate colors for text and borders
- **Success**: Green for completed actions
- **Neutral**: Gray tones for inactive states

## üîß Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Users are loaded only when dropdown is opened
- Search filtering happens client-side for responsiveness
- Component re-renders are optimized with proper state management

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- Console logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

## üìù Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Pagination**: For large user lists
2. **Role-based Filtering**: Filter users by role/department
3. **Recent Selections**: Show recently selected users
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select all/none functionality
5. **Custom Avatars**: Support for user profile images

### Integration Options
- Can be used in other forms (deals, tasks, projects)
- Adaptable for different user types (clients, team members, vendors)
- Configurable for different selection rules

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Single selection works correctly
- [ ] Multiple selection works correctly
- [ ] Search functionality filters users
- [ ] Selected people can be removed
- [ ] Form submission includes people data
- [ ] Edit mode loads existing selections
- [ ] Error states display properly
- [ ] Loading states work correctly

### Common Issues
1. **API Connection**: Ensure backend is running and accessible
2. **Data Format**: Check that API returns expected user structure
3. **State Management**: Verify parent component handles selection changes
4. **Performance**: Monitor for slow loading with large user lists

## üí° Tips for Developers

### Best Practices
1. Always handle empty/null user lists gracefully
2. Provide meaningful placeholder text
3. Use consistent data transformation patterns
4. Implement proper error boundaries
5. Test with different user data scenarios

### Debugging
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify data transformation in contactService
3. Use React DevTools to inspect component state
4. Test with different user account types
